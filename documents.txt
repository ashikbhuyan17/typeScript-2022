TypeScript Types 👍
Built-in Data types: TypeScript has some pre-defined data-types-
------------------>>>>>Number,Boolean,String,Void,Null,Undefined,Any

User-defined Types 👍
------------------>>>>>Enumerations (enums), classes, interfaces, arrays, and tuple

Interface vs type
- both are nearly similar in most cases.
- However, Adding new filed after creation is possible for an interface but not possible for a type.
